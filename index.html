                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi ! I’m <strong>Daegan</strong>, I speak fluently in French and English, and moderately in Spanish.</p>
                <p>There’s one thing I love to do : <strong>Coding</strong> !</p>

                <p>Whether it’s for web sites, apps or video games, that’s what I do, and I take great pleasure in it. It feels liberating being able to make something creative out of my own hands and mind, even the technical and logical challenges feel (even though frustrating at times) like a game to me, and when I manage to get through it, it’s exhilarating.</p>

                <p>So far, having learned all that I could by myself, I yearn to work with a team to get a genuine experience and help me learn new ways to develop creations. I want to understand what it means working on big projects, having to work and communicate efficiently with colleagues and clients alike, and to be as fast and clean as possible.</p>

                <p>I have yet to have this type of experience, but I’m soooo ready to actually get going and to finally dive in this ever expanding universe.</p>
                <p>Of course, while I want to work on web sites and applications, my end goal is to be a video game developer. Eventually, I want to make my own games, and I’m starting to get into it. I already have an idea of what I want to do, all that is lacking right now is just knowledge and knowing which engine(s) I want to learn more and use.</p>

                <p>This is all I have to say about me for now, but as time goes on, and as I get more knowledgeable, meet new people, and create new projects, I want to be able to look back at this web page and see everything that I would have done, expanding it along the way. To me it’s important to remember how I started, and rejoice in future past victories !</p>

                <p>Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just share ideas :</p>
